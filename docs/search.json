    "text": "2.1 Updating Beliefs: The Power of Bayesian Thinking\nAn important example of this is the development of a gameplan. Coaches watch lots of film to understand the tendencies, strengths, and weaknesses of each team they compete against. Before watching the film, your beliefs about a given team can be fairly broad. You may have heard the team shoots a lot of three or likes feeding the post, etc. Once you engage with material that potentially reinforces this idea, your uncertainty decreases and you are more “willing” to commit to certain actions since you know they more than likely would happen. If you were unsure that someone on the opposing team would still shoot even on a closeout but watching film you see repeatedly they are a quick trigger, you are more certain that this would be a viable strategy to defend against them.\nThis doesn’t only happen in pre-game planning. This happens during the game as you adjust your players, offense, and defense matchups according to new information you perceive over the course of the game."
