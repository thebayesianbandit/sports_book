    "text": "I wrote this book as a way to better understand causal inference in my domain of business. The term “levers” is repeadetly used in the business world as a way of saying “What can we control?”. I was formally trained as a statistician in my educational pursuits and within my classes we would discuss aspects of causal inference. However, as I have continued through my business degree, understanding better the different “levers” within business and what effects they have was deeply interesting to me. I began researching things like uplift modeling and discovered this world of causality."
