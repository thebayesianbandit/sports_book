    "text": "Growing up, I played a lot of sports. Football was the most popular option in my youth, but after a leg injury, I decided it wasn’t for me. That’s when basketball took center stage.\nI grew to love the game. Beyond the physical benefits, the sport provided a lifetime of memories and friendships. I spent countless hours playing pickup with friends at parks and rec centers, eventually moving into leagues ranging from competitive high school play to community leagues.\nWhile my passion for the game grew, it also faced moments of stunted growth. Coaches exert a profound influence on a player’s love for the sport. Sadly, I had coaches who made me question whether I wanted to keep playing at all. Looking back, I realize I wasn’t losing my love for the game itself; I was losing my faith in the systems my coaches had put in place.\nMany coaches preach that effort equals playing time. I took that to heart, working relentlessly in practice to prove my readiness. Yet, when game time arrived, I remained on the bench. I will be the first to admit I wasn’t a physical specimen who could easily out-shoot or overpower opponents. However, the frustration stemmed from a fundamental disconnect: I was following the “system” my coach had established, yet I wasn’t receiving the promised reward.\nYears later, as I have progressed through different educational opportunities and jobs, I’ve realized that this wasn’t just a basketball issue. This is a fundamental issue across many industries. Many people in positions of organizational influence expect success in a certain metric without providing the frameworks or means to achieve what they desire.\nAs I have pondered the good and the bad I experienced in those situations, I have come to realize that those who expected and achieved success all had one thing in common: they had people who understood systems thinking.\nFrom a basketball perspective, this is what separates the good coaches from the great ones. Good coaches know they need results, but they almost “hope” that success will occur by trying different things. Great coaches know how to systematically organize their team—from understanding the “why” behind their philosophies, to implementing them via game plans, to executing it all in-game. Great coaches know how to adjust levers within the entire ecosystem at their disposal to create their own success.\nThis book takes a mathematical approach to systems thinking. I believe that mathematical tools can enhance systems thinking since mathematics is the language of quantified metrics. Through a mathematical lens, we can take traditional basketball thinking and augment the “how” and “why” with mathematical formulae.\nIn the end, coaches don’t need to be expert mathematicians to succeed. However, those who use the contents of this book to enhance their systems thinking will find they can easily apply these principles to their own teams and better understand how to create their own success."

    "text": "1.1 Updating Beliefs: The Power of Bayesian Thinking\nAn important example of this is the development of a gameplan. Coaches watch lots of film to understand the tendencies, strengths, and weaknesses of each team they compete against. Before watching the film, your beliefs about a given team can be fairly broad. You may have heard the team shoots a lot of three or likes feeding the post, etc. Once you engage with material that potentially reinforces this idea, your uncertainty decreases and you are more “willing” to commit to certain actions since you know they more than likely would happen. If you were unsure that someone on the opposing team would still shoot even on a closeout but watching film you see repeatedly they are a quick trigger, you are more certain that this would be a viable strategy to defend against them.\nThis doesn’t only happen in pre-game planning. This happens during the game as you adjust your players, offense, and defense matchups according to new information you perceive over the course of the game.\nMathematically, this can be modeled using Bayesian statistics. The story on how Bayesian statistics came to be essentially goes like this. Back in the 1700s, an english minister by the name of Thomas Bayes wanted to essentially prove that the resurrection occurred. To do this, he asked a profound question: if you don’t know the certainty of an event, how can you calculate the probability of that event happening given observed events? This led Bayes to publish his paper An Essay towards solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances [1] where he formalized this phenemon. That is, as people see new evidence on a particular matter, their beliefs are updated based on the strength of the evidence.\nIn the game of basketball, this is crucial to recognize, especially as a coach. Let’s walk through the mathematics of this using some visualizations. Let’s say that you are preparing to play a team that is great at moving the ball. They’re an unselfish team that excels at making sure everyone touches the ball before a shot attempt. You want to understand how often they pass because you think that if you can accurately “predict” on what number pass they will attempt to shoot, you can better prepare your defense for a shot and subsequent rebound attempt.\nA simple way we could model this is using a Poisson distribution. Poisson distributions are handy for calculating the number of discrete events that take place in a given period of time (in our case, a single half-court possession). The probability mass function (PMF) for the Poisson distribution is shown below.\n\\[\nP(k \\mid \\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!}\n\\tag{1.2}\\]\nThis PMF simply states that the probability that we observe \\(k\\) number of passes given a distribution parameter \\(\\lambda\\) is equal to what you see in Equation 1.2. For example, below is the PMF where \\(\\lambda\\) = 3.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Poisson PMF where lambda = 3\n\n\n\n\nThe plot above merely shows the frequency each value \\(k\\) should occur based on our belief that the average frequency (\\(\\lambda\\)) is equal to 3. The most frequent value here is 3 which makes sense since that is the average of this kind of distribution. To get a probability from this, just plug the value \\(k\\) into the equation Equation 1.2. Using that, we get the probability of the team making exactly 3 passes in a given possession to be ~22%.\nBut how certain are you that the average number of passes is exactly 3? How much data have you collected that would show that they always have this kind of distribution for number of passes in a given offesnive possession? This is where Bayesian updating comes in. We don’t have to stick with just 3 \\(\\lambda\\) parameter. We can have lambda take on a whole distribution of values that represent our uncertainty about it. The way we model this is shown in Equation 1.3.\n\\[\nP(\\lambda | D) = \\frac{P(D | \\lambda) P(\\lambda)}{P(D)}\n\\tag{1.3}\\]\nThe equation above is what we discussed earlier with Sir Thomas Bayes. In words, Equation 1.3 states that our beliefs are updated based on new data we receive. In the context of our basketball scouting, our belief of the average number of passes in a given offensive possesion \\(\\lambda\\) is updated by the data we receive \\(D\\) through a simple ratio. The numerator is the product between our prior beliefs \\(P(\\lambda)\\) and the likelihood of our beliefs \\(P(D|\\lambda)\\) divided by the probability of observing the data \\(P(D)\\).\n\n\n\n\n[1] T.
