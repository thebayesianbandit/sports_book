    "text": "In his book Leading with the Heart, Coach Krzyzewski lays out in the early chapters the importance of establishing an identity for any team. He credits a lot of this thought to his familiar upbringing where his parents instilled in him and his siblings the importance of family values. He also credits a lot of this to his military training where each member of a unit knew the importance of knowing their role to play in the success of an assignment. In short, who Coach Kryzyewski was drove a lot of how he ran his basketball team. Integrity was an important principle on the team because he valued it in his own life, and the list goes on of how he built his teams around these common attributes.\nCoach Kryzewski isn’t the only one who does this. Everyone has beliefs that influence how they approach work. The trick though is identifying what those beliefs are in order to check if the actions we are performing are aligned with the values we espouse having.\nIn 1954, statistician Leonard J. Savage published The Foundations of Statistics [Savage1954]. In this work, Savage introduced several models demonstrating how subjective beliefs influence decision-making. The most notable of these models is Subjective Expected Utility (SEU), shown in Equation 2.1.\n\\[\nU(f) = \\int_{S} u(f(s)) p(s) \\, ds\n\\tag{2.1}\\]\nBreaking down the formula a bit, we say that the expected utility of an individual (\\(U(f)\\)) is equal to the integral of the state space \\(S\\), the utility function \\(u(f(s))\\), and the subjective probability density function (PDF) \\(p(s)\\). What this “complex” formula is essentially saying is that we make decisions based on our perceived values and our current information. The perceived values are represented via the utility function as that mathematically maps our tastes and preferences to a more “measurable” area. The PDF is how we currently perceive how likely our outcomes are that derive our utility.\nThat was a lot of mathematic and economic jargon, so let’s move into an example that most people can relate to: what is the quickest way to get home. Let’s pose for a moment that we don’t have google maps to tell us which route is the “quickest” way to get home. As well, let’s suppose there are only two ways to get home: via the freeway or through town. Your utility is highest when your commute is as short as possible (ie by minimizing your commute time, you maximize utility). You know that the freeway is the fastest way to get home, but you believe there is about a 30% chance that there is an accident on the freeway and that would slow things down considerably. The other way through town is the slowest option, but you know that there is only about a 5% chance there is an accident. Which way would you choose?\nThis is the SEU model in action. We all have “imperfect” information (\\(p(s)\\)) along with personal preferences (\\(u(f(s))\\)) that drive our decisions. Recognizing this and formalizing it in a mathematical model helps us to do two things: understand what our current beliefs are and what we currently decide based on those decisions."
