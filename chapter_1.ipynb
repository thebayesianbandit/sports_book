    "In his book *Leading with the Heart*, Coach Krzyzewski lays out in the early chapters the importance of establishing an identity for any team. He credits a lot of this thought to his familiar upbringing where his parents instilled in him and his siblings the importance of family values. He also credits a lot of this to his military training where each member of a unit knew the importance of knowing their role to play in the success of an assignment. In short, who Coach Kryzyewski was drove a lot of how he ran his basketball team. Integrity was an important principle on the team because he valued it in his own life, and the list goes on of how he built his teams around these common attributes."

    "In 1954, an academic by the name of **Leonard J. Savage** published the book *The Foundations of Statistics* [Savage1954].
